# GoodNews

Sentiment Analysis Model to predict good or positive news from Headlines.

### Motivation

After the coronavirus pandemic started the news article had started being overwhelmingly negative with lots of news article covering the death tolls and economic crisis. If we look at the Google Trend on “Positive News” or “Good News” during the time when the Pandemic started, we can clearly see the need of a portal with just positive news.
